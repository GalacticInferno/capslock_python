Glitching weirdness is a term of endearment, right?
Recompiling my combat code!
I can't feel my fingers! Gah! I don't have any fingers!
My assets... frozen!
Brrh... So cold... brrh...
Too cold... can't move!
Metal gears... frozen solid!
Why do I even feel pain?!
Why did they build me out of galvanized flesh?!
If only my chassis... weren't made of recycled human body parts! Wahahaha!
Hey everybody, check out my package!
Running the sequencer!
You can't just program this level of excitement!
Push this button, flip this dongle, voila! Help me!
square the I, carry the 1... YES!
Resequencing combat protocols!
I have an IDEA!
I'm a sexy dinosaur! Rawr!
Oh god I can't stop!
(unintelligible snarling)
I AM ON FIRE!!! OH GOD, PUT ME OUT!!!
I'm a robot ninja...
Tell me I'm the prettiest!
Some days, you just can't get rid of an obscure pop-culture reference.
Uh, how do I cast magic missile?
You can call me Gandalf!
I'll stop talking when I'm dead!
I'll die the way I lived: annoying!
I'll never go back to the bad place!
Can I shoot something now? Or climb some stairs? SOMETHING exciting?
Times like these, I really start to question the meaning of my existence. Then I get distra-hey! What's this? This looks cool!
How does math work? Does this skin make me look fat? If a giraffe and a car had a baby, would it be called a caraffe? Life's big questions, man.
Who needs memories when I can do all this cool stuff? Stuff that I currently am not doing! That's what I'd like to call a 'hint'.
It's really quiet... and lonely... (hums briefly) Also this 'stopped moving' thing makes me uncomfortable. It gives me time to stop and think... literally. I'VE STOPPED, AND I'M THINKING! IT HURTS ME!
